            <blockquote>
                "The world is vast, but which lands stand out on the cinematic map? 
                Seek out the top representatives from each region."</blockquote>
            <p> Let‚Äôs begin by analyzing the number of movies produced by each country : </p>

                <p class="plot-description">
                    This barplot shows that the main global movie producer is the USA, whose industry is highly developed compared to the rest of the world. The USA produces at least four times more movies than the second-largest producer, India.
                    It appears that the USA, India, the UK, Japan, and Argentina are the leading representatives for their respective regions.
            </div>

            <div class="plot-container">
                <p>Let's analyze the amount a money generated with the film industry to confirm our previous findings :</p>

                <p class="plot-description">
                This distribution is very different than the previous one. It tells us that the countries that produce the more movies are not ones making the more money with this industry. For example, India is the second producer but is also the country that makes the least money for each film compared to the 18 biggest producers in the world.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p> USA, India, UK, Japan, Argentina and Iran seem to be good representatives of the movie film industry of their regions. 
                Iran was included to represent its region, despite not being one of the top movie producers.</p>

            <div class="plot-container">
                <p>Let's take a closer look at the distribution of the box office movie revenues for our selected countries :</p>

                <p class="plot-description">

                <p class="plot-description"></p>
                The global trend that we see on the 6 graphs is an increase of the movie production between 1890 and 2007. We can interpret these results and estimate that the advancement of new technologies worldwide is the major cause of this increase.

                We can observe a drop in the american movie production around 1915 which coincides with World War I. During World War II we notice a huge decrease of number of movies for the UK and Argentina and a less important one for the USA. UK and USA were directly involved in the World War II while Argentina had the influence of Germany and Italy.
                
                <br>
                <p>
                    Okay now we are all agree to say that USA, India, UK, Japan, Argentina and Iran are the top representatives countries of film industry for their region.
                    Let's see if the code is linked to them !

        <section id="clue2" class="clue-section">
            <h2>Clue 2: GPD impact</h2>
            <blockquote>"As economies rose and fell, the silver screen reflected their 
                fortunes, weaving a tale of cinema's evolution shaped by the ebb and flow of global GDP."</blockquote>

            <br>
            <p> First, let's see the direct impact of GDP of the countries on the total box office revenue by performing a Pearson correlation :</p>
            <p class="correlation"> Correlation coefficient = 0,09<br>P-value = 4 √ó 10<sup>-19</sup></p>
            <p>There is a small but significant correlation between Movie box office revenue and GDP</p>
            <br>
            <p> Then, we performed a Pearson correlation to estimate the direct impact of GDP of the countries on the number of film produced :</p>
            <p class="correlation"> Correlation coefficient = 0,23<br>P-value = 0,32</p>
            <p>The correlation between the number of film produced and the GDP is not significant. </p>

            <!-- Plot 2 -->
            <div class="plot-container">
                <p>Let's evaluate the importance of different features in the total box office :</p>

                <p class="plot-description">
                    The 5 features that are not significant are actor height, age and the movie genres romance, drama and crime. We notice that their coefficients have small absolute values. We can observe that the coefficient of GDP is large and positive, which means that the wealthier the countries, the more their industry is developed.

            <h2>Clue 3: Actors gender</h2>
            <blockquote>"Where there‚Äôs talent, there‚Äôs a story. Discover how the gender of actors shapes the narrative."</blockquote>
            <div class="plot-container">
                <p>Let's see the evolution of gender distribution over time and countries :</p>
                <div id="plotgender">
                    <iframe src="assets/graphs/actor_gender_plots.html" width="100%" height="700" style="border:none;" scrolling="no"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p class="plot-description">
                    Concerning the USA, India, the UK and Japan we notice that the gender distribution is in favor of males, with on average 60% of actors and 40% of actresses in the movies throughout the years. Since 1940, the distribution did not really change, we observe a plateau in the curve of those 4 countries, the ratio is staying approximately the same. No countries put real efforts in establishing gender equality in their movie industry. Concerning Argentina and Iran, the results are oscillating a lot, we cannot observe any trend. We think that there are not enough data to draw conclusions.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> Let‚Äôs perform additional analyses to obtain other results.</p>
            </div>

            <p> The Pearson correlation estimates if the ratio of female/male actors is significant in the success of a movie :</p>
            <p class="correlation"> Correlation coefficient = 0,24<br>P-value = 1,31 √ó 10<sup>-57</sup></p>
            <p>The P-value is really small. There is a significant relation between the ratio and the box office revenue, however it is probably not linear. </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Now that we know the correlation is significant, let‚Äôs try to find the optimal ratio for success by performing a quadratic regression. We can then find the value of x corresponding to df/dx = 0, which is given by  ‚àíb/2a. In the case of the curve representing box office revenues as a function of the ratio, the value of 
                x is 10.47. To maximize the chances of producing a blockbuster, the number of actors should be approximately 10 times higher than the number of actresses. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Wait whattt?! Well, at least we found a number... </p>

This interpretation is inherently subjective, as each topic is a mix of ideas that cannot be fully captured by a single label, but it highly simplify our analysis so let‚Äôs make this simplification!

                    The graph shows clear cultural differences in movie themes across six countries. Family and Love (Topic 0) are prominent in India, Iran, and Argentina, reflecting a strong focus on emotional and familial storytelling. The United States and United Kingdom show a more balanced mix, with an emphasis on Relationships and Home Life (Topic 1) alongside elements of thrillers and action. Japan, on the other hand, stands out with a higher representation of Action and Adventure (Topic 3), reflecting a preference for dynamic, group-driven narratives often seen in genres like anime and sci-fi.

                    To get a clearer picture, we‚Äôll apply LDA to individual genres. This will help us find more precise themes and see how stories vary from one region to another.
