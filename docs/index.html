                <p class="plot-description">
                    This barplot shows the main global movies producer is the USA. Their industry is really developped compared to the rest of the world. There are producing at least 4 times more movies than the second biggest producer which is India.
                    It seems that USA, India, UK, Japan and Argentina are the top representatives for their region, let's find the one for Africa.
            </div>

                <p>Let's analyze the amount a money generated with the film industry to confirm our previous findings </p>

                <p class="plot-description"></p>
                This distribution is in log scale because the values of box office revenues are extremely different depending on the different countries.
                This distribution is very different than the previous one. It tells us that the contries that produce the more movies are not ones making the more money with this industry. For example, India is the second producer but is also the country that makes the least money for each film compared to the 18 biggest producers in the world. The wealthiest countries are the countries with the highest box offices per movie independantely of the level of production.
                <br>
                However, There is still no country for Africa aarhhg. Let takes a closer look at Iran, to see if it can match with the other countries.

                <p class="plot-description">
                    India is the second country with the highest number of films produced however the boxplot shows that the movie box office revenue per film is lower than UK, Japan or Argentina even if these countries produce less films. 

                    USA is still the first country and there are a lot of outliers with a high movie box office revenue. 
                    
                    Argentina is the 7 country with the highest nb of films produced, after USA, India, UK and Japan. However, we can observe that in mean, it has a highest movie box office revenue per film than these countries. It also has a lower difference between first and third quartile. However it has just one outliers with a abnormaly high movie box office revenue. 
                    
                    Iran is the country with the lowest number of film produced and also, in average, the lowest movie box office revenue. Nonetheless, it has the lowest gap between whiskers meaning that the distribution of the box office revenue per film is consistent.</p>

                <br>
                <p> USA, India, UK, Japan, Argentina and Iran seem to be goood representatives of the movie film industry of their regions.</p>

            <div class="plot-container">
                <p>Let's do the final check and examine the timeline of cinema evolution across them:</p>

                </div>
                <p class="plot-description"></p>
                The global trend that we see on the 6 graphs is an increase of the movie production between 1890 and 2007. We can interprate those result and estimate that the advancement of new technologies worldwide are the major cause of this increase.

                We can observe a drop in the american movie production around 1915 which coincides with World War I. It did not really affected the UK because their movie production was very low at that time. India, Argentina, Iran and Japan was not involved in World War I. Concerning World War II the observation is a bit different. We notice a huge decrease of number of movie for the UK and Argentina around 1939-1945 and a less important one for the USA. UK and USA were directly involved in the World War II while Argentina had the influence of Germany and Italy. Moreover, the number of movies produced per yer before 1940 for Japan is very low but we can observe that this number increases a lot after World War II. 

                Around 2007, we discern a fall of prodcution for the 6 countries. This date corresponds to the appearance of Netflix, a platform that offers a streaming service of movies, series. People can access to huge number of movies very easily without having to go to cinema theatres. 2008 economic crisis could also have an impact on this production of movies.
                <br>
                <p> Okay now we are all agree to say that USA, India, UK, Japan, Argentina and Iran are the top representatives countries of film industry for their region.
                    Let's see if the clue is linked to them !

            <p> "As economies rose and fell, the silver screen reflected their fortunes, weaving a tale of cinema's evolution shaped by the ebb and flow of global GDP."</p>


            <br>
            <p> First, we performed a Pearson correlation to estimate the direct impact of GDP of the countries on the total box office revenue. Here are the results :</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Correlation coefficient = 0,09</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> P-value = 4 √ó 10<sup>-19</sup></p>
            <p>There is a small but significant correlation between Movie box office revenue and GDP</p>
            <br>
            <p> Then, we performed a Pearson correlation to estimate the direct impact of GDP of the countries on the number of film produced. Here are the results :</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Correlation coefficient = 0,23</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> P-value = 0,32</p>
            <p>TThe correlation between the number of film produced and the GDP is not significant. </p>

            <h2>Clue 3: Actors gender</h2>

            <div class="plot-container">

                </div>
                <p class="plot-description">Concerning the USA, India, the UK and Japan we notice that the gender distribution is in favor of males, with on average 60% of actors and 40% of actresses in the movies throughout the years. Since 1940, the distribution did not really change, we observe a plateau in the curve of those 4 countries, the ratio is staying approximetaly the same. No countries put real efforts in establishing gender euquality in their movie industry. Concerning Argentina and Iran, the results are oscillating a lot, we cannot observe any trend. We think that there are not enough data to draw conclusions.
                </p>
            </div>

            <br>
            <p> The Pearson correlation estimates if the ratio of female/male actors is significant ofr the success of a mive. Here are the results :</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Correlation coefficient = 0,24</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> P-value = 1,31 √ó 10<sup>-57</sup></p>
            <p>The P-value is really small. There is a significant relation between the ratio and the box office revenue, however it is probably not linear. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Once we knew that the correlation was significant we tried te find the optimal ratio for success. We performed a linear regression of degree 2, found the value of x corresponding to df/dx = 0. It corresponds to -b/2a. In the case of the curve of box office revenues in terms of ratios the value of x = 10,47.

                To maximise the chance to produce a blockbuster, the number of actors should be 10 times higher than the number of actresses.</p>
