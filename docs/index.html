                    This barplot shows the main global movies producer is the USA. Their industry is really developped compared to the rest of the world. There are producing at least 4 times more movies than the second biggest producer which is India.
                    It seems that USA, India, UK, Japan and Argentina are the top representatives for their region, let's find the one for Africa.

                <p class="plot-description"></p>
                This distribution is in log scale because the values of box office revenues are extremely different depending on the different countries.
                This distribution is very different than the previous one. It tells us that the contries that produce the more movies are not ones making the more money with this industry. For example, India is the second producer but is also the country that makes the least money for each film compared to the 18 biggest producers in the world. The wealthiest countries are the countries with the highest box offices per movie independantely of the level of production.
                <br>
                However, There is still no country for Africa aarhhg. Let takes a closer look at Iran, to see if it can match with the other countries.

                <p class="plot-description">
                    India is the second country with the highest number of films produced however the boxplot shows that the movie box office revenue per film is lower than UK, Japan or Argentina even if these countries produce less films.

                    USA is still the first country and there are a lot of outliers with a high movie box office revenue.

                    Argentina is the 7 country with the highest nb of films produced, after USA, India, UK and Japan. However, we can observe that in mean, it has a highest movie box office revenue per film than these countries. It also has a lower difference between first and third quartile. However it has just one outliers with a abnormaly high movie box office revenue.

                    Iran is the country with the lowest number of film produced and also, in average, the lowest movie box office revenue. Nonetheless, it has the lowest gap between whiskers meaning that the distribution of the box office revenue per film is consistent.

                <br>
                <p> USA, India, UK, Japan, Argentina and Iran seem to be goood representatives of the movie film industry of their regions.</p>

            <div class="plot-container">

                <p class="plot-description"></p>
                The global trend that we see on the 6 graphs is an increase of the movie production between 1890 and 2007. We can interprate those result and estimate that the advancement of new technologies worldwide are the major cause of this increase.

                We can observe a drop in the american movie production around 1915 which coincides with World War I. It did not really affected the UK because their movie production was very low at that time. India, Argentina, Iran and Japan was not involved in World War I. Concerning World War II the observation is a bit different. We notice a huge decrease of number of movie for the UK and Argentina around 1939-1945 and a less important one for the USA. UK and USA were directly involved in the World War II while Argentina had the influence of Germany and Italy. Moreover, the number of movies produced per yer before 1940 for Japan is very low but we can observe that this number increases a lot after World War II.

                Around 2007, we discern a fall of prodcution for the 6 countries. This date corresponds to the appearance of Netflix, a platform that offers a streaming service of movies, series. People can access to huge number of movies very easily without having to go to cinema theatres. 2008 economic crisis could also have an impact on this production of movies.
                <br>
                <p>
                    Okay now we are all agree to say that USA, India, UK, Japan, Argentina and Iran are the top representatives countries of film industry for their region.
                    Let's see if the clue is linked to them !

            <p> "As economies rose and fell, the silver screen reflected their fortunes, weaving a tale of cinema's evolution shaped by the ebb and flow of global GDP."</p>


            <br>
            <p> First, we performed a Pearson correlation to estimate the direct impact of GDP of the countries on the total box office revenue. Here are the results :</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Correlation coefficient = 0,09</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> P-value = 4 √ó 10<sup>-19</sup></p>
            <p>There is a small but significant correlation between Movie box office revenue and GDP</p>
            <br>
            <p> Then, we performed a Pearson correlation to estimate the direct impact of GDP of the countries on the number of film produced. Here are the results :</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Correlation coefficient = 0,23</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> P-value = 0,32</p>
            <p>TThe correlation between the number of film produced and the GDP is not significant. </p>

            <p>"Where there‚Äôs talent, there‚Äôs a story. Discover how the gender of actors shapes the narrative."</p>
            <div class="plot-container">
                <p>Let's evaluate the importance of different features in the total box office</p>

                <p class="plot-description">
                    Concerning the USA, India, the UK and Japan we notice that the gender distribution is in favor of males, with on average 60% of actors and 40% of actresses in the movies throughout the years. Since 1940, the distribution did not really change, we observe a plateau in the curve of those 4 countries, the ratio is staying approximetaly the same. No countries put real efforts in establishing gender euquality in their movie industry. Concerning Argentina and Iran, the results are oscillating a lot, we cannot observe any trend. We think that there are not enough data to draw conclusions.
                </p>
            </div>

            <br>
            <p> The Pearson correlation estimates if the ratio of female/male actors is significant ofr the success of a mive. Here are the results :</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Correlation coefficient = 0,24</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> P-value = 1,31 √ó 10<sup>-57</sup></p>
            <p>The P-value is really small. There is a significant relation between the ratio and the box office revenue, however it is probably not linear. </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Once we knew that the correlation was significant we tried te find the optimal ratio for success. We performed a linear regression of degree 2, found the value of x corresponding to df/dx = 0. It corresponds to -b/2a. In the case of the curve of box office revenues in terms of ratios the value of x = 10,47.

                To maximise the chance to produce a blockbuster, the number of actors should be 10 times higher than the number of actresses.

                    To uncover the topics in a collection of texts, we use
                    <strong>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)</strong>
                    . LDA is a method designed specifically for
                    <strong>topic modeling</strong>
                    . It looks at the patterns of words in documents and groups words that frequently occur together into
                    <strong>topics</strong>
                    . The idea is simple: each document is made up of a mix of topics, and each topic is described by a specific set of words.
                </p>

                    By applying LDA to movie plots, we can figure out which topics are most common in films from different countries. This helps us see what kinds of stories people focus on and how they vary from one place to another.

                <p id="618e6fa4-7320-4422-a6c1-c2f06da8d235" class="">
                    We‚Äôll start by applying LDA to look at movies in a
                    <strong>broad, general way</strong>
                    , analyzing themes across all genres. This gives us a big-picture view of storytelling worldwide. But is that enough? Can broad themes really capture the cultural differences we‚Äôre looking for, or do we need to go further?

                    Like many machine learning models, LDA needs
                    <strong>tuning</strong>
                    to get the best results. In our case, the key parameter to tune is the
                    <strong>number of topics</strong>
                    . A good way to find the right number is to try models with different topic counts‚Äîsay, from 2 to 5‚Äîand choose the one that gives us the
                    <strong>most coherent topics</strong>
                    . Coherence measures how interpretable and meaningful the topics are.

So as we increase the number of topics, we might find that the coherence score keeps improving. Why? Because with more topics, the model gets more specific, breaking down themes into smaller, clearer pieces.

                    However, a more coherent model doesn‚Äôt always mean a better one. If we choose too many topics, the results become so specific that they‚Äôre hard to interpret. How are we supposed to understand 20 topics a make an interesting comparison?

                    within the range of 2 to 5 topics. This will give us themes that are specific enough to be meaningful but broad enough to interpret easily.

                    <strong>Family and Love (Topic 0)</strong>
                    are prominent in India, Iran, and Argentina, reflecting a strong focus on emotional and familial storytelling. The United States and United Kingdom show a more balanced mix, with an emphasis on
                    <strong>Relationships and Home Life (Topic 1)</strong>
                    alongside elements of thrillers and action. Japan, on the other hand, stands out with a higher representation of
                    <strong>Action and Adventure (Topic 3)</strong>
                    , reflecting a preference for dynamic, group-driven narratives often seen in genres like anime and sci-fi.

                    These general themes give us a broad understanding of storytelling patterns across different regions, but they also raise new questions. Are these overarching topics enough to capture the cultural nuances in the stories told around the world? Or do the unique differences lie hidden within more

                    , where more individual and relationship-driven narratives are prominent.
                    <strong>Topic 1</strong>
                    (family and relationships) is notably significant in
                    <strong>Argentina</strong>
                    and
                    <strong>Japan</strong>
                    , indicating a balanced interest in family-centric romance.

                    Overall, while themes of
                    <strong>family and relationships</strong>
                    are universal, countries like
                    <strong>India</strong>
                    ,
                    <strong>Iran</strong>
                    , and
                    <strong>Japan</strong>
                    consistently prioritize
                    <strong>familial and emotional ties</strong>
                    across genres. Western countries such as the
                    <strong>United States</strong>
                    and
                    <strong>United Kingdom</strong>
                    incorporate a broader mix of themes, often blending individual struggles, domestic issues, and crime with family narratives. This reflects a cultural contrast between collective and individualistic storytelling approaches.
