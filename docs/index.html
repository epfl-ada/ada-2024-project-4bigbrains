                    This barplot shows the main global movies producer is the USA. Their industry is really developped compared to the rest of the world. There are producing at least 4 times more movies than the second biggest producer which is India.
                    It seems that USA, India, UK, Japan and Argentina are the top representatives for their region, let's find the one for Africa.

                <p class="plot-description"></p>
                This distribution is in log scale because the values of box office revenues are extremely different depending on the different countries.
                This distribution is very different than the previous one. It tells us that the contries that produce the more movies are not ones making the more money with this industry. For example, India is the second producer but is also the country that makes the least money for each film compared to the 18 biggest producers in the world. The wealthiest countries are the countries with the highest box offices per movie independantely of the level of production.
                <br>
                However, There is still no country for Africa aarhhg. Let takes a closer look at Iran, to see if it can match with the other countries.

                <p class="plot-description">
                    India is the second country with the highest number of films produced however the boxplot shows that the movie box office revenue per film is lower than UK, Japan or Argentina even if these countries produce less films.

                    USA is still the first country and there are a lot of outliers with a high movie box office revenue.

                    Argentina is the 7 country with the highest nb of films produced, after USA, India, UK and Japan. However, we can observe that in mean, it has a highest movie box office revenue per film than these countries. It also has a lower difference between first and third quartile. However it has just one outliers with a abnormaly high movie box office revenue.

                    Iran is the country with the lowest number of film produced and also, in average, the lowest movie box office revenue. Nonetheless, it has the lowest gap between whiskers meaning that the distribution of the box office revenue per film is consistent.

                <br>
                <p> USA, India, UK, Japan, Argentina and Iran seem to be goood representatives of the movie film industry of their regions.</p>

            <div class="plot-container">

                <p class="plot-description"></p>
                The global trend that we see on the 6 graphs is an increase of the movie production between 1890 and 2007. We can interprate those result and estimate that the advancement of new technologies worldwide are the major cause of this increase.

                We can observe a drop in the american movie production around 1915 which coincides with World War I. It did not really affected the UK because their movie production was very low at that time. India, Argentina, Iran and Japan was not involved in World War I. Concerning World War II the observation is a bit different. We notice a huge decrease of number of movie for the UK and Argentina around 1939-1945 and a less important one for the USA. UK and USA were directly involved in the World War II while Argentina had the influence of Germany and Italy. Moreover, the number of movies produced per yer before 1940 for Japan is very low but we can observe that this number increases a lot after World War II.

                Around 2007, we discern a fall of prodcution for the 6 countries. This date corresponds to the appearance of Netflix, a platform that offers a streaming service of movies, series. People can access to huge number of movies very easily without having to go to cinema theatres. 2008 economic crisis could also have an impact on this production of movies.
                <br>
                <p>
                    Okay now we are all agree to say that USA, India, UK, Japan, Argentina and Iran are the top representatives countries of film industry for their region.
                    Let's see if the clue is linked to them !

            <p> "As economies rose and fell, the silver screen reflected their fortunes, weaving a tale of cinema's evolution shaped by the ebb and flow of global GDP."</p>


            <br>
            <p> First, we performed a Pearson correlation to estimate the direct impact of GDP of the countries on the total box office revenue. Here are the results :</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Correlation coefficient = 0,09</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> P-value = 4 √ó 10<sup>-19</sup></p>

            <h2>Clue 3: Actors gender</h2>
            <p>"Where there‚Äôs talent, there‚Äôs a story. Discover how the gender of actors shapes the narrative."</p>
            <div class="plot-container">
                <p>Let's evaluate the importance of different features in the total box office</p>

                <p class="plot-description">
                    Concerning the USA, India, the UK and Japan we notice that the gender distribution is in favor of males, with on average 60% of actors and 40% of actresses in the movies throughout the years. Since 1940, the distribution did not really change, we observe a plateau in the curve of those 4 countries, the ratio is staying approximetaly the same. No countries put real efforts in establishing gender euquality in their movie industry. Concerning Argentina and Iran, the results are oscillating a lot, we cannot observe any trend. We think that there are not enough data to draw conclusions.
                </p>
            </div>

            <br>
            <p> The Pearson correlation estimates if the ratio of female/male actors is significant ofr the success of a mive. Here are the results :</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Correlation coefficient = 0,24</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> P-value = 1,31 √ó 10<sup>-57</sup></p>
            <p>The P-value is really small. There is a significant relation between the ratio and the box office revenue, however it is probably not linear. </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Once we knew that the correlation was significant we tried te find the optimal ratio for success. We performed a linear regression of degree 2, found the value of x corresponding to df/dx = 0. It corresponds to -b/2a. In the case of the curve of box office revenues in terms of ratios the value of x = 10,47.

                To maximise the chance to produce a blockbuster, the number of actors should be 10 times higher than the number of actresses.

            <p>"Look closer at the stories themselves; what do different lands dream about?"</p>
            <div class="page-body">
                <h3><strong>Deciphering the Clue</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    This clue invites us to explore the stories told across different parts of the world. What do these stories reveal about each region? What kinds of narratives are shared, and how do they differ? To answer these questions, we need a clear and systematic way to identify and compare the main ideas within these stories.
                </p>
                <h3><strong>Method</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    To uncover the topics in a collection of texts, we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). LDA is a method designed specifically for topic modeling. It looks at the patterns of words in documents and groups words that frequently occur together into topics. The idea is simple: each document is made up of a mix of topics, and each topic is described by a specific set of words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By applying LDA to movie plots, we can figure out which topics are most common in films from different countries. This helps us see what kinds of stories people focus on and how they vary from one place to another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We‚Äôll start by applying LDA to look at movies in a broad, general way, analyzing themes across all genres. This gives us a big-picture view of storytelling worldwide. But is that enough? Can broad themes really capture the cultural differences we‚Äôre looking for, or do we need to go further?
                </p>
                <p>
                    This first step will help us decide. Once we‚Äôve identified the general themes, we can narrow our focus to specific genres to dig deeper and see what makes each region unique.
                </p>
                <h3><strong>General LDA Analysis</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    Like many machine learning models, LDA needs tuning to get the best results. In our case, the key parameter to tune is the number of topics. A good way to find the right number is to try models with different topic counts and choose the one that gives us the most coherent topics. Coherence measures how interpretable and meaningful the topics are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But there‚Äôs a catch, isn‚Äôt there? Think about it: in cinema, there are countless topics; thankfully! So as we increase the number of topics, we might find that the coherence score keeps improving. Why? Because with more topics, the model gets more specific, breaking down themes into smaller, clearer pieces.
                </p>
                <div id="plot1" style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
                    <img src="assets/graphs/optimization_topics_general_1.png" 
                         alt="Optimization of topics"
                         style="width: 60%; height: auto; display: inline-block;">
                </div>
                <p>
                    However, a more coherent model doesn‚Äôt always mean a better one. If we choose too many topics, the results become so specific that they‚Äôre hard to interpret. How are we supposed to understand 20 topics a make an interesting comparison?
                </p>
                <p>
                    To strike a balance, let‚Äôs focus on finding the most coherent model within the range of 2 to 5 topics. This will give us themes that are specific enough to be meaningful but broad enough to interpret easily.
                </p>
                <div id="plot2" style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">

                </div>
                <p>
                    No doubt, 4 topics is the perfect compromise between interpretability and coherence of the LDA model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To better understand each topic, we examined the top 10 most representative words associated with it. These words give us a clear sense of the recurring ideas within each theme. Additionally, we identified the movie most strongly associated with each topic, providing a concrete example of how the theme is reflected in cinema.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here‚Äôs what we found:

                    The four topics can be characterized as follows:
                </p>
                <ul class="bulleted-list">
                    <li style="list-style-type:disc">Topic 0:  Family and Love</li>

                <ul class="bulleted-list">
                    <li style="list-style-type:disc">Topic 3:  Action and Adventure</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These topics are a simplification of the LDA results, based on the most representative words and movies. This interpretation is inherently subjective, as each topic is a mix of ideas that cannot be fully captured by a single label, but it highly simplify our analysis so let‚Äôs make this simplification!
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is finally time to compare the repartition of topics between the focus countries:
                </p>
                <div id="plot3" style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
                    <iframe src="assets/graphs/Standardized_Distribution_Movie.html" width="100%" height="700" style="border:none;" scrolling="no"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The graph shows clear cultural differences in movie themes across six countries. Family and Love (Topic 0) are prominent in India, Iran, and Argentina, reflecting a strong focus on emotional and familial storytelling. The United States and United Kingdom show a more balanced mix, with an emphasis on Relationships and Home Life (Topic 1) alongside elements of thrillers and action. Japan, on the other hand, stands out with a higher representation of Action and Adventure (Topic 3), reflecting a preference for dynamic, group-driven narratives often seen in genres like anime and sci-fi. 
                    <br/>
                    These general themes give us a broad understanding of storytelling patterns across different regions, but they also raise new questions. Are these overarching topics enough to capture the cultural nuances in the stories told around the world? Or do the unique differences lie hidden within more specific genres?
                    <br/>
                    To get a clearer picture, we‚Äôll apply LDA to individual genres. This will help us find more precise themes and see how stories vary from one region to another.
                    <br/>
                </p>
                <h3><strong>Genre specific LDA analysis</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>First, how do we decide which genres to analyze?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To ensure unbiased results, we need a large enough sample size. For this, we focus on the movie genres in our dataset that contain more than 1,000 entries each:
                </p>
                <div id="plot4" style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
                    <iframe src="assets/graphs/Number_movies_per_genreromancemerge.html" width="100%" height="700" style="border:none;" scrolling="no"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p>
                    From this, we focus on the Thriller, Drama, and Romance genres.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <strong>Secondly, how do we choose the number of topics for each genre?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We follow the same method as with the general LDA: testing different numbers of topics (2 to 5) and selecting the number that maximizes the coherence score. This ensures the topics are both coherent and interpretable for each genre:
                </p>
                <div id="plot5" style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
                    <iframe src="assets/graphs/OptimisationGenre.html" width="100%" height="700" style="border:none;" scrolling="no"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p>
                    <br/>
                    For Romance, the coherence score peaks at 3 topics before declining. In the case of Thriller, the score initially decreases but rises sharply at 5 topics. Finally for Drama, the score reaches its highest point at 4 topics before dropping, making 4 the optimal choice.
                    <br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is finally time! let‚Äôs work on the three selected genres one by one.
                </p>

Topic 1 (domestic crime) is notably prevalent in Iran, where it accounts for the entire distribution, suggesting a focus on intimate and home-based thrillers. Topics 2 and 3, which include action-packed thrillers with elements of crime and missions, are more balanced across Japan and the United Kingdom, reflecting a diverse range of thriller subgenres in these regions. Meanwhile, Topic 0 has a moderate presence in all countries but does not dominate any specific one. This distribution highlights cultural preferences in thriller movies, with some countries leaning more toward family-centric plots, while others emphasize action, crime, or organized operations.

                <h3>Summary of Genre Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    Overall, while themes of family and relationships are universal, countries like India, Iran, and Japan consistently prioritize familial and emotional ties across genres. Western countries such as the United States and United Kingdom incorporate a broader mix of themes, often blending individual struggles, domestic issues, and crime with family narratives. This reflects a cultural contrast between collective and individualistic storytelling approaches.
