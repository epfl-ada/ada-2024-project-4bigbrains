                    This barplot shows the main global movies producer is the USA. Their industry is really developped compared to the rest of the world. There are producing at least 4 times more movies than the second biggest producer which is India.

                This distribution is in log scale because the values of box office revenues are extremely different depending on the different countries
This distribution is very different than the previous one. It tells us that the contries that produce the more movies are not ones making the more money with this industry. For example, India is the second producer but is also the country that makes the least money for each film compared to the 18 biggest producers in the world. The wealthiest countries are the countries with the highest box offices per movie independantely of the level of production.

                    India is the second country with the highest number of films produced however the boxplot shows that the movie box office revenue per film is lower than UK, Japan or Argentina even if these countries produce less films. 

                    USA is still the first country and there are a lot of outliers with a high movie box office revenue. 
                    
                    Argentina is the 7 country with the highest nb of films produced, after USA, India, UK and Japan. However, we can observe that in mean, it has a highest movie box office revenue per film than these countries. It also has a lower difference between first and third quartile. However it has just one outliers with a abnormaly high movie box office revenue. 
                    
                    Iran is the country with the lowest number of film produced and also, in average, the lowest movie box office revenue. Nonetheless, it has the lowest gap between whiskers meaning that the distribution of the box office revenue per film is consistent.</p>

                The global trend that we see on the 6 graphs is an increase of the movie production between 1890 and 2007. We can interprate those result and estimate that the advancement of new technologies worldwide are the major cause of this increase.

    We can observe a drop in the american movie production around 1915 which coincides with World War I. It did not really affected the UK because their movie production was very low at that time. India, Argentina, Iran and Japan was not involved in World War I. Concerning World War II the observation is a bit different. We notice a huge decrease of number of movie for the UK and Argentina around 1939-1945 and a less important one for the USA. UK and USA were directly involved in the World War II while Argentina had the influence of Germany and Italy. Moreover, the number of movies produced per yer before 1940 for Japan is very low but we can observe that this number increases a lot after World War II. 

    Around 2007, we discern a fall of prodcution for the 6 countries. This date corresponds to the appearance of Netflix, a platform that offers a streaming service of movies, series. People can access to huge number of movies very easily without having to go to cinema theatres. 2008 economic crisis could also have an impact on this production of movies.
